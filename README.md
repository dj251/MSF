This repository documents my learning journey through various coursework and self-initiated projects. It includes:

-> Projects completed as part of my academic curriculum
-> Independent projects inspired by topics I found interesting online

The goal of this repository is to showcase my practical understanding of key concepts and to track my progress in applying them through hands-on work.
